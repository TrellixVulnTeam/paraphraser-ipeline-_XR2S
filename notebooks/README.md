# Notebooks

This directory contains notebooks with some relevant research we have conducted.

## Structure
* Metrics - Research for metrics
* Datasets - Analyse for some datasets we used. Script that we used to combine datasets and filter too similar sentences.
* Other - Research for different topics.
* First prototypes - First training attempts.

## Warnings
* We have not tried to "clean" or improve the code for first prototypes. Instead, we have created a new training loop,
  see final_fine_tuning.py. The first prototypes were added as kind of "history notice", not as final results or example of 
  correct code or similar.
* Paths used in the notebooks will be not correct for you, so you have to change the paths.
* We were not able to upload the datasets & models to GitHub because of the memory limitations. 
  However, you can find the datasets in internet.
