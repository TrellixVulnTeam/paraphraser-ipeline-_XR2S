The screen is so easy on the eyes .
The text is easy on my eyes .
I have not experienced eye, strain .
Eye strain is completely non, existant in my experience .
The e ink is so comfortable on the eyes .
E-ink hardly strains your eyes .
As it gets lateI simply pump up the character size which eases tired eyes .
It's also easy to make the font larger whenever necessary, like when my eyes are tired .
I also really like the way it shows my speed and the posted speed limit .
I liked the way it tells you the speed limit and how fast you are going .
Love the speed limit and actual speed indicators .
Indicates posted speed limits of the road you are on
The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .
Lastly  , you can immediately see the speed limit for every road you are on .

Earily evening free wine tasting   .
No free internet here though .
Internet access was not free .
The free morning coffee and evening wine reception were both good opportunities to meet other guests .
The free morning coffee is also well appreciated and attended .
Guests actually talk to one another during morning coffee, and the free hour of wine at 5 pm .
We did however take advantage of the free coffee and biscotti that was offered every morning in the lobby .
Free coffee in the lobby in the mornings is nice .
We did however make use of the free tea and coffee when we had an early start .
Free coffee in the morning, free beer and wine in the afternoon, what more could you ask for ?
Oh, yes, free coffee and biscotti for breakfast, and wine in the afternoon !
There's free coffee, teas at breakfast time with little biscotti and, best of all, from 5 til 6pm you get a free wine 'tasting' reception   which, as long as you don't take the p
Morning coffee and biscotti was a nice touch as well as the all you can drink free wine hour in the evening .
We went down for the free wine reception, and had a great time .

The customer service stinks .
Could have had a bit nicer service .
The service was the worst service we have EVER recieved in my life the worst .
Customer Service needs improvement .
If you dont mind the attitude of dealing with a rude staff, go for it .
My one issue was with the staff .
Front Desk Staff were shockingly bad .
Concierge staff were snooty and were not very helpful .
The staff really need to take a class in interpersonal communication .
The staff is quite unfriendly and unaccomodating .
front desk staff need customer service 101 .
The staff at the front desk and the concierge were a bunch of snobs as well ,  very arrogant .

It's also a shame that this model comes with a glossy screen .
As others have noted, I wish the screen wasn't so reflective .
The greatest shortcoming is the small screen resolution .
The small screen is probably the biggest drawback .
Hard to see full web pages on small screen, resolution inadequate .
Tiny screen compromises the experience of web surfing
Price was unbeatable, just 79 pounds night .
We got this for $75 a night, which is a lot cheaper than any listed price we could find .
Overall, for the price  , it is a pretty good deal .
Hard to find better at this price .
A very good value for the price .
The quality was very good and the price was reasonable .
The transmission is not the smoothest .
The transmission is  driving  me crazy .
The transmission is just terrible .
However, the transmission is sloppy .

My transmission works seamlessly and there are no quality issues whatsoever .
No rattles or transmission problems .

No transmission flares, hesitations, rattles or any other problems .
The transmission cant make up its mind it hesitates to shift .
The transmission hesitates, also downshifts, hunting between gears, then lurches   .
The transmission hesitates and stumbles .
Transmission has a very strange hesitation when shifting .
It's automatic transmission is jerky and sometimes hesitant about changing gears .
However, the transmission is a little confused at times during downshifting .
The engine transmission was a Jekyll Hyde affair .
The transmission constantly shifts back and forth between gears .
Transmission does not know sometimes what it is doing when it ?
Terrible transmission that doesn't shift right .
The transmission computer is a major issue .
The transmission leaves a lot to be desired .
It has major transmission issues, which I have had fixed twice .
However, there are too many problems with the transmission .
No sign of the transmission problem people have complained about, but I'm not expecting a Porsche .
No transmission problems as reported by so many others .
Many people have mentioned a hesitation in the transmission  I haven't seen it .
However I have noticed, like others, that the new transmission is not that smooth, especially when accelerating from a stop .
I have the transmission problem .
Like everyone else, I have the problem with the transmission .
Only problem has been the proprietary transmission glitch everyone talks about .
I've had the same transmission problems hesitation issues as everyone else .
The transmission is the absolute WORST, it is very dangerous and can cause an accident .
Transmission is terrible ,  acceleration lag is a safety issue .
High quality inside outside finish
Disappointed in interior and exterior quality .
The ride, the fit and the build quality are what I was expecting after owning Toyotas in the past .
It's now apparent that Toyota quality took a nose dive .
However, the quality is absolutely terrible for a Toyota .
However, the quality of this car is not acceptable for Toyota standards .
This is not the Toyota quality I was expecting .
Toyota's quality is slipping .
I had always heard that Toyota had the best quality cars .
Toyota has this  supposed  impecable quality .
Toyota did a great job with design but forgot about quality !
While I applaud the new design  , Toyota seems to be slipping in quality .
This car needs quality improvement !
This car looks great and the build quality is good .
As of today, I am a bit disappointed in the build quality of the car .
Interior quality is very poor .
Horrible quality of interior .
The fit and finish in the cabin is not the level of quality I expected .
Some quality issues with fit and finish .
The fit and finish quality is poor .
Very disappointed in mileage .
Fuel mileage has been less than expected .
Nowhere near the mileage the sticker shows .
The EPA mileage ratings and what the dealer bragged about mileage wise are a joke .
Telling me how good the gas mileage is not true .
Thought gas mileage would be better .
I am so very disappointed with the gas mileage !
Gas mileage not quite as good as advertised .

The only odd thing is that is has a video camera but doesn't have a single shot camera .
Love the camera, but wish it had photo capabilities, rather than just video .
Seems kinda silly that they would go right to video and completely neglect photography .
It will take video, but not pictures  ?
Secondly, the thing has the capability to record video, but won't take pictures .
Yeah, that's typed correctly ,  video, but not pictures .
I find it weird that it will take video but not still pics .
Video recorder only, cannot take just photos .
The video camera is nice, just wish it could take stills .
I do wish that it also took pictures as well as video though .
It's just a shame it only takes video and not still photos .
The video capability is incredible, and so easy to use .
The video looks great and it's easy to use .
the video quality is perfect .
The videos are so clear I just love it .
I love the seats, they are supportive .

Very user friendly, great sound .
It is very easy to set up and use plus has great sound .
The earphones sound good, but slides out of your ears and have to be pushed back in to get the full sound effect .
I love the sound quality of the earbuds, but they fit horribly in my ears .
Earphones sound good, but slides out of ears .
One or two larger font sizes would have benefited the visually impaired .
Maximum font size is still not big enough for people with vision problems .
What's more, it's easy to change font size .
The font sizes are easy to switch between and very usable .

the room is just the smallest darn thing you'll ever see .
The room was extremely small .
The room was big enough to hold one large size suitcase, and nothing more .
The room was uncomfortably small and very tired .
The room itself   was pokey, drab and stuffy .
Our room was small and the wooden furniture was badly chipped and marked .
The rooms are quite small but the problem is they really could use some renovation .

The rooms were spotlessly clean and serviced each day .
The rooms were cleaned spic and span every day .
Programs load and run faster than ever .
My notebook runs so much faster .
When I ran Vista, it was a bit slower .
faster about 20% to 30% faster at running applications than my Vista ,  seriously
This is much faster than visata and I love it .
For these two computers, normal use is pretty fast,  not quite as fast as Windows XP SP3, but very close .
Also, in my non, benchmarked experience, Windows 7 has been at least as fast as XP if not faster .
It's fast, secure, stable, visually appealing and fun to use .
fast, stable, compatible, and cool .
Fast startup and performance
Also it starts faster and runs things faster .
Windows 7 is overall faster than Windows XP .
faster than XP in many areas on my system .
W7 does everything so much faster also .
Now Window 7 runs smoothly, 10, 20% faster overall .
But Windows 7 is definitely faster !
My system boots much faster, and shuts down almost instantly now .
Some of the things I like most about Windows 7 is how fast it boots up and shuts off .
The upgrade process was simple, fast, and went perfectly .
I have to say it was the smoothest, fastest, and easiest install since doing a DOS install .
The speed at which the upgrade completed is quite fast and the driver hardware detection was seamless .
I am disappointed with the gas mileage .
Mileage a little disappointing .
Biggest disapointment is gas mileage .
To top things off, the car gets terrible mileage .
Would like to see better gas mileage too .
The gas mileage is not what its cracked up to be .
Gas mileage is only about 22 around town .
Gas mileage is disappointing, 21 in town .
In town driving the mileage has been 20 .

Gas mileage is about 20 in the city, certainly not that great .

This is by far the most comfortable vehicle I have owned .

This car is very comfortable car to drive .
The time that it takes to acqure the Satellites is about 10, 30 seconds .
It doesn't take long to locate satellites, maybe 15 seconds or so .
The satellite fix is very fast, about twice as fast as my old one .
Hotfix   to lock on to satellite signals works well .
The revised chipset allows the GPS to make satellite connections quickly .
Picked up satellites very quickly .
Improved super fast satellite acquisition
It's fast to acquire satellites .
It also finds the satellite quickly .
Satellite acquisition time is very fast, as is re, routing .
It grabs satellites quickly and recalculates routes in seconds after I veer off in the wrong direction .
The recalculate time is excellent, so is the satellite signal connection .
The unit takes very quickly locks on to satellite signals, tracks very well and when you miss a turn or do something unexpected, recalculates a new route very quickly .

In terms of battery life its not really 10 .
The ~10 hour battery life is great .
And over 9 hours of battery life !
I have found the actual battery life to be around 8 hours   .
Realistic battery numbers are between 8 .
That 5, way button is magical .
I love the 4, way directional button .
Tiny buttons with even tinier text on the buttons .
The incredibly tiny buttons are literally impossible for people with low, vision to read .
And the tiny buttons with the even tinier text ?
A minor grumble, I keep wanting to press Next Page rather than the select button to make things happen .
I intuitively want the biggest button to be 'select' rather than Next Page .
I also love the fact they made the next and previous page buttons a little bit harder to push so I am not constantly pressing buttons I don't mean to .
It is much harder now to accidentally hit the page buttons .
Next page and other buttons ,  very easy to use .
The buttons really are much better .
I find the buttons easy to use .
Greatly improved page turning buttons .
The page turn buttons are better .
