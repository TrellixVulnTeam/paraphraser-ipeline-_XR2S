# Model Directory

The files for paraphrasing model, i.e. `config.json` and `pytorch_model.bin`, should be located here.
However, the model is too big to be uploaded to GIT, so it will uploaded to other place. 

As for 2021-11-29, we recommend to use epoch #12 of the `t5-small-combined-reduced_v1` model,
i.e. the model that was fine-tuned on combined dataset which was <b>not</b> filtered according to the diversity.

TODO: Choose the place where to upload the model.
